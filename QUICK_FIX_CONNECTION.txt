QUICK FIX: "Connection Refused" Error
=====================================

YOU'RE USING THE WRONG PORT!

Problem:
- You're accessing: localhost:8080
- But XAMPP Apache runs on port 80
- That's why you get "connection refused"

QUICK FIX (3 Steps):

1. START XAMPP
   - Open XAMPP Control Panel
   - Click "Start" for Apache (wait for GREEN)
   - Click "Start" for MySQL (wait for GREEN)

2. USE CORRECT URL
   - Use: http://localhost/campusflow/
   - NOT: localhost:8080
   - NOT: http://127.0.0.1:5500/

3. CHECK PROJECT LOCATION
   - Must be in: C:\xampp\htdocs\campusflow\
   - If not, copy it there

THAT'S IT!

Test:
1. Open: http://localhost/ (should show XAMPP page)
2. Open: http://localhost/campusflow/ (should show login page)

If Apache won't start:
- Port 80 is in use (close Skype)
- Or change Apache port to 8080 in XAMPP config
- Then use: http://localhost:8080/campusflow/
