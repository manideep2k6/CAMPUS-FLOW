QUICK FIX FOR NETWORK ERROR ON LOGIN/REGISTER
=============================================

MOST COMMON FIXES (Try these first):

1. CHECK XAMPP IS RUNNING
   - Open XAMPP Control Panel
   - Make sure Apache shows "Running" (green)
   - Make sure MySQL shows "Running" (green)
   - If not, click "Start" button

2. CHECK YOU'RE USING THE CORRECT URL
   - Use: http://localhost/campusflow/
   - NOT: file:///C:/xampp/htdocs/campusflow/
   - The URL must start with "http://"

3. TEST THE API DIRECTLY
   - Open browser and go to: http://localhost/campusflow/test_api.php
   - This will tell you what's wrong
   - Fix any issues shown

4. CHECK DATABASE EXISTS
   - Go to: http://localhost/phpmyadmin
   - Look for database named "campus_flow"
   - If it doesn't exist, create it and import database.sql

5. CHECK FILE PATHS
   - Make sure files are in: C:\xampp\htdocs\campusflow\
   - Verify these files exist:
     * api/auth.php
     * js/auth.js
     * config.php
     * index.html

6. CHECK BROWSER CONSOLE
   - Press F12 in browser
   - Go to "Console" tab
   - Try to login
   - Look for red error messages
   - Share the error if you see one

7. RESTART SERVICES
   - In XAMPP, click "Stop" for Apache
   - Wait 2 seconds
   - Click "Start" for Apache
   - Try again

IF STILL NOT WORKING:

1. Run test_api.php to see detailed errors
2. Check TROUBLESHOOTING.md for more solutions
3. Verify all files are in correct folders
4. Make sure folder name is exactly "campusflow" (no spaces)

TEST FILE CREATED:
- test_api.php - Run this to diagnose issues
- Check the output to see what's wrong
