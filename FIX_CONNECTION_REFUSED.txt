FIX: "localhost refused to connect" ERROR
==========================================

PROBLEM:
You're trying to access: localhost:8080
But nothing is running on port 8080!

SOLUTION:
XAMPP Apache runs on port 80 (default), not 8080.
You should access: http://localhost/campusflow/

STEP-BY-STEP FIX:

STEP 1: CHECK XAMPP STATUS
---------------------------
1. Open XAMPP Control Panel
2. Look at Apache - is it GREEN (Running)?
   - If RED or not running: Click "Start" button
   - Wait until it turns GREEN
3. Look at MySQL - is it GREEN (Running)?
   - If RED or not running: Click "Start" button
   - Wait until it turns GREEN

STEP 2: VERIFY APACHE IS RUNNING
---------------------------------
1. Open browser
2. Go to: http://localhost/
3. You should see "XAMPP" welcome page
4. If you see this, Apache is working! ✅

STEP 3: CHECK YOUR PROJECT LOCATION
------------------------------------
Your project MUST be in:
C:\xampp\htdocs\campusflow\

Check if this folder exists:
1. Open File Explorer
2. Go to: C:\xampp\htdocs\
3. Look for folder: campusflow
4. If it doesn't exist:
   - Copy your project folder there
   - Rename it to: campusflow

STEP 4: ACCESS YOUR APPLICATION
--------------------------------
Use these URLs (NOT port 8080):

✅ CORRECT URLs:
- http://localhost/campusflow/
- http://localhost/campusflow/index.html
- http://localhost/campusflow/check_setup.php

❌ WRONG URLs (Don't use these):
- localhost:8080 (nothing runs here)
- http://127.0.0.1:5500/ (Live Server)
- file:///C:/xampp/htdocs/... (file:// protocol)

STEP 5: IF APACHE WON'T START
------------------------------
Problem: Apache shows RED in XAMPP

Solutions:
1. Port 80 is already in use:
   - Close Skype (it uses port 80)
   - Close other web servers
   - Or change Apache port in XAMPP config

2. Change Apache port:
   - Open XAMPP Control Panel
   - Click "Config" next to Apache
   - Select "httpd.conf"
   - Find: Listen 80
   - Change to: Listen 8080
   - Save and restart Apache
   - Then use: http://localhost:8080/campusflow/

STEP 6: TEST YOUR SETUP
-----------------------
1. Open: http://localhost/campusflow/check_setup.php
2. This will show you what's working and what's not
3. Fix any red errors shown

COMMON ISSUES:

Issue 1: "Apache won't start"
→ Solution: Check if port 80 is in use
→ Close Skype or other apps using port 80
→ Or change Apache port to 8080 (see Step 5)

Issue 2: "Can't find files"
→ Solution: Make sure files are in C:\xampp\htdocs\campusflow\
→ Check folder name is exactly "campusflow"

Issue 3: "Database connection failed"
→ Solution: Make sure MySQL is running (green in XAMPP)
→ Create database "campus_flow" in phpMyAdmin
→ Import database.sql

QUICK CHECKLIST:
----------------
[ ] XAMPP Control Panel is open
[ ] Apache is GREEN (Running)
[ ] MySQL is GREEN (Running)
[ ] Project is in: C:\xampp\htdocs\campusflow\
[ ] Accessing via: http://localhost/campusflow/
[ ] NOT using: localhost:8080 (unless you changed Apache port)

TEST COMMANDS:
--------------
1. Test Apache: http://localhost/
   → Should show XAMPP welcome page

2. Test Project: http://localhost/campusflow/
   → Should show login page

3. Test Setup: http://localhost/campusflow/check_setup.php
   → Should show diagnostic page

IF STILL NOT WORKING:
---------------------
1. Check XAMPP error logs:
   - C:\xampp\apache\logs\error.log
   - Look for error messages

2. Try different port:
   - Change Apache to port 8080 (see Step 5)
   - Then use: http://localhost:8080/campusflow/

3. Check Windows Firewall:
   - Make sure XAMPP/Apache is allowed
   - Or temporarily disable firewall to test

REMEMBER:
---------
- XAMPP Apache = Port 80 (or whatever you set)
- Access via: http://localhost/campusflow/
- NOT: localhost:8080 (unless you changed port)
- Make sure Apache is RUNNING (green in XAMPP)
